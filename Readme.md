# COME: Dual Structure-Semantic Learning with Collaborative MoE for Universal Lesion Detection Across Heterogeneous Ultrasound Datasets
We propose the <u>**Co**</u>llaborative <u>**M**</u>ixture of Heterogeneous <u>**E**</u>xperts (COME), a novel framework for lesion detection across multiple heterogeneous US datasets that synergistically integrates dual structural-semantic priors with intra-dataset specific feature disentanglement.


# Datasets
We evaluate the proposed **COME** under three training paradigms for the detection tasks: single dataset, intra-organ consolidation dataset, and inter-organ integration dataset. This includes four breast US datasets (BUS1 [1], BUV [2], BUSBRA [3], BUSC [4] and four thyroid datasets (DDTI [1], TUD [2], TUS [3], TNSCUI [4]), as detailed in the following firgure.  ![picture](https://github.com/UniversalCOME/UniversalCOME/blob/main/img/data.png). 

All datasets exhibit heterogeneous characteristics from different imaging devices or protocols, manifesting as variations in shadow artifacts, speckle noise patterns, intensity distributions, and the scales of regions of interest.

**We are continuously expanding our intra-organ and inter-organ datasets and will continue to update them in the future...**


# Usage
Device: Experiments are conducted on two NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPUs with 24GB of memory.  
It is highly recommanded to adopt Conda/MiniConda to manage the environment to avoid some compilation errors.
